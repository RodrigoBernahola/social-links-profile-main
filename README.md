## My process

I started creating the HTML boilerplate and the structure first. Then i started using flex and changing the default styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that its more effective to style things from inside first and then going to the outer boxes. Also, i understood that trying to make my design at a perfect size at first its not a good idea.


### Continued development

I would like to continuing making exercises on this page so i can have a good amount of practice when i start learning new technologies.
